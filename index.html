                <h2>What Is Wasted Food?</h2>
                <p>There are two main kinds of wasted food: food loss and food waste</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Food loss is the bigger category, and incorporates any edible food that goes uneaten at any stage. In addition to food that’s uneaten in homes and stores, this includes crops left in the field, food that spoils in transportation, and all other food that doesn’t make it to a store.</li>
                    <li> Some produce that does not meet strict retailer or consumer cosmetic standards goes to suppliers for processing, but even if they are willing to accept the produce, the supplier must be close enough to justify transportation costs and able to accept large volumes of produce.</li>
                    <li> Edible food is discarded at every point along the food chain: on farms and fishing boats, during processing and distribution, in retail stores, in restaurants and at home.<p><a href="section1.html">Click here</a> </p></li>

                <h2>Food Loss impacts on enviornment</h2>
                <p>Food wastage is a serious problem that affects the environment in many ways. According to the web search results, some of the environmental impacts of food wastage are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Waste of natural resources: When food is wasted, all the resources that were used to produce it, such as water, land, energy, labour and capital, are also wasted</li>
                        <li> Contribution to climate change: When food is thrown away, it ends up in landfills where it decomposes and releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. Food wastage accounts for about 8% of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions and generates 8% of greenhouse gases annually</li>
                        <li> Degradation of biodiversity: When food is wasted, it reduces the availability of food for other living organisms, such as animals and plants, and disrupts the natural balance of ecosystems. <a href="section2.html">Click here...</a> </li>
